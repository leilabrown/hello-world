# hello-world
I guess this is an intro to GitHub? I don't know though.
Anyways, I dropped my computer last night and the screen partially shattered. Yeah, not great. It's still 100% functional, thank the universe. BUt it's a little annoying. I think that over time, I'll get used to it though. As far as problems go, this one is pretty 1st world. I'm just grateful that I have the resources to replace it when I need too (not anytime soon!). And it's a lesson to be more careful with my objects. It could've been worse. No more elctronics in the bathroom!!! Maybe if I stick with that for 6 months, I will buy myself a new computer. We'll see. I stopped myself from worrying too much about it in the moment, which was good of me. Thankfully, my computer screen doesn't define me. And my carlessness didn't hurt anyone. See ya!
